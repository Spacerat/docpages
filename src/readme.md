# `src` directory

## [cli.ts](/src/cli.ts)
This is the main source file.

It implements a full CLI inteface using Commander and Mustache templates.
## [types.d.ts](/src/types.d.ts)
We use glob-gitignore to handle ignoring all files ignored by gitignore.

This file is necessary since it does not have typescript types.
